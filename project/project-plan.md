# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Is Rail Transport a better option for travel within europe to tackle climate change .

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does traveliing by train within Europe is feasible solution to avoid effect to Airlines on climate in Europe?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In recent times, availability of cheap air travel attracts lot of people to choose Air routes as main source of travel. But we know that these cheap flights emits tons of CO2 in atmosphere which is one of the driving factors of Climate Change. In this project we are trying to analyze, whether we can use Rail Transport where it is necessary instead of flights, is this affects CO2 emission and also is it feasible(considering time and cost).We will look into data from two sources describing CO2 emission by each type of transport per passenger and also cost to travelling per km per passenger. 

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
